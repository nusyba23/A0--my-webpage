# Tangible HCI Projects Website

Welcome to my **Tangible Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** website! This repository contains a series of projects built using Arduino and designed to explore creative interactions through tangible interfaces.

## Project Overview

This website serves as a portfolio for my Tangible HCI course, showcasing different assignments and projects that involve working with physical devices and sensors, like LEDs and buttons, controlled through Arduino.

### Featured Projects

   - Description: A simple LED blink project where the light doesn't just turn on and off but fades in slowly and fades out after pressing a button. Inspired by automatic room lighting systems.
   - Materials: Arduino Uno, LED, Resistor, Button, Jumper Wires.
